                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>Created by Ashley Kostelac, the Ostel Foundation Nonprofit Organization emerged from a deeply personal journey of loss, healing, and resilience. Ashley's life took an unexpected turn when what was meant to be the happiest day of her life, her wedding day, instead became a funeral, a day of mourning as her husband-to-be, CW04 Richard K. Vigil, a decorated Sailor of the Year for the United States Navy, tragically lost his battle with PTSD. Richard's experiences as a service member, including multiple tours in the Middle East, left lasting scars that eventually led to his untimely passing.</p>
                <p>The aftermath of this devastating loss left Ashley, her son, and her family grappling with their own trauma and grief. Then less than a year into this grief journey, trauma struck again in 2018 when Ashley was kidnapped and raped by a complete stranger in downtown Pensacola. Ashley and her family were riddled with PTSD and desperately trying to cope in society as a single and traumatized mother.  </p>
                <p>Then came the opportunity for Ashley to achieve her childhood dream of having her own horses in her backyard. Through years of rebuilding their lives and seeking solace in nature, they found themselves creating Ostel Place, a sanctuary that became a source of healing and renewal for each of them. Surrounded by horses, dogs, and the tranquility of nature, they embarked on individual journeys of healing and transformation.</p>
                <p>The profound impact of this healing environment inspired Ashley to establish Ostel Vets ‘n’ Pets, recognizing the therapeutic power of animals and nature in supporting the well-being of veterans, families, and individuals facing trauma and challenges. Drawing from her own experiences and witnessing the positive effects on her loved ones and community members, Ashley founded Ostel Vets ‘n’ Pets to provide a space where healing, connection, and hope could flourish.</p>
                <p>As Ostel Vets ‘n’ Pets evolved into Ostel Foundation, its mission expanded to encompass a broader vision of healing and empowerment through healing with horses, nature and dogs. Today, the Ostel Foundation continues to honor Richard's memory and the journey of healing that began at Ostel Place, offering a beacon of hope and healing for all who seek solace and support on their path to wellness.</p>
